### Assignment

In this challenge you must analyze demographic data using Pandas. You are given a dataset of demographic data that was extracted from the 1994 Census database. Here is a sample of what the data looks like:

|    |   age | workclass        |   fnlwgt | education   |   education-num | marital-status     | occupation        | relationship   | race   | sex    |   capital-gain |   capital-loss |   hours-per-week | native-country   | salary   |
|---:|------:|:-----------------|---------:|:------------|----------------:|:-------------------|:------------------|:---------------|:-------|:-------|---------------:|---------------:|-----------------:|:-----------------|:---------|

You must use Pandas to answer the following questions:

* How many people of each race are represented in this dataset? This should be a Pandas series with race names as the index labels. (```race``` column)
* What is the average age of men? *39.4*
* What is the percentage of people who have a Bachelor's degree?
* What percentage of people with advanced education (```Bachelors```, ```Masters```, or ```Doctorate```) make more than 50K?
