# [ðŸ“Š Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/)

Data Analysis has been around for a long time. But up until a few years ago, developers practiced it using expensive, closed-source tools like Tableau. But recently, Python, SQL, and other open libraries have changed Data Analysis forever.

In the Data Analysis with Python Certification I learnt the fundamentals of data analysis with Python like reading data from sources like CSVs and SQL, and using libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to process and visualize data.

In above directories you can see all my projects created in this course.
