# [📊 Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/)

Data Analysis has been around for a long time. But up until a few years ago, developers practiced it using expensive, closed-source tools like Tableau. But recently, Python, SQL, and other open libraries have changed Data Analysis forever.

In the Data Analysis with Python Certification I learnt the fundamentals of data analysis with Python like reading data from sources like CSVs and SQL, and using libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to process and visualize data.

In above directories you can see all projects created in this course such as:

* **[🧮 Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator](https://github.com/m-ressel/Data-Analysis-with-Python/tree/main/Mean-Variance-Standard%20Deviation%20Calculator)** - a function that uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix
* **[🧍 Demographic Data Analyzer](https://github.com/m-ressel/Data-Analysis-with-Python/tree/main/Demographic-Data-Analyzer)** - analyzing demographic data using Pandas
* **[🩺 Medical Data Visualizer](https://github.com/m-ressel/Data-Analysis-with-Python/tree/main/Medical-Data-Visualizer)** - normalizing, converting and cleaning the data, creating a correlation matrix, plotting a categorical plot and a heat map.
* **[🗓️ Page View Time Series Visualizer](https://github.com/m-ressel/Data-Analysis-with-Python/tree/main/Page-View-Time-Series-Visualizer)** - visualizing data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots.
* **[🌊 Sea Level Predictor](https://github.com/m-ressel/Data-Analysis-with-Python/tree/main/Sea-Level-Predictor)** - predicting the sea level change through years, creating a scatter plot
